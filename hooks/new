    Before deploying, please be sure to import the keypair generated for you from
    Vault into AWS console.

    First run the following command to get the public key:

      safe get secret/$GENESIS_VAULT_PREFIX/aws/ssh:public

    Then go to EC2 > Key Pairs > Import Key Pair and:

      1. Type 'vcap@$GENESIS_ENVIRONMENT' in the 'Key pair name' input box
      2. Paste the safe command output into the 'Public key contents' input box
      3. Click 'Import' button

    Now you can SSH into VMs deployed by this director using the generated key.
