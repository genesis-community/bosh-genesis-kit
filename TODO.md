1. Use the secrets from the parent bosh as default values for CPI secrets

2. Provide a with-vault feature that adds a single vault job on the director
   instance -- not compatible with vault-credhub-proxy (same port)

3. Offer to import the secrets into the bosh-vault on initial deployment
   completion. (post-deploy hook, in conjuction with pre-deploy hook detecting
   that it is a brand-new deploy)

4. Have genesis create a local vault for initialization of secrets that will
   then be imported into the bosh vault on first deployment.

   This will require genesis to support generate-on-new-deploy for secrets,
   including those secrets generated by the new-wizard.
      - maybe it doesn't need to be genesis that creates the inital local
        vault, but the new wizard does...
      - Rethink: still needs to be built into genesis because genesis looks for
        a vault.  In fact, genesis init asks for a vault...
