params:
  base:
    - ask: What IP should be used for your BOSH director?
      description: |
        This defines the IP that BOSH will be deployed on.
        It should be a an IP from the static IP pool on the network
        you are deploying the VM onto. Usually the BOSH manifest
        will handle this via `networks`, but the IP is
        required to create the SSL certificate for BOSH, prior
        to deploying. If you change this, make sure to
        have genesis regenerate your SSL certificate.
      param: static_ip
    - ask: What hostname will be used to access your BOSH director?
      description:
        This is the FQDN for the above  `static_ip`.

  bosh:
    - ask: What is the name of the BOSH director that will be deploying this BOSH VM?
      description: |
        This value is required for non-Proto-BOSH BOSHes.
        It indicates the target alias of the BOSH that
        will be used to deploy this BOSH. If you do
        not have a BOSH to deploy this BOSH from,
        you will want to use the `bosh-init` kit to
        deploy this as a Proto-BOSH.
