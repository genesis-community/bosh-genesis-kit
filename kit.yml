    - param: static_ip
      ask: What IP should I assign to the new BOSH director?
      description: |
        This defines the IP that BOSH will be deployed on.  It should be a
        an IP from the static IP pool on the network you are deploying the
        VM onto. Usually the BOSH manifest will handle this via `networks`,
        but the IP is required to create the SSL certificate for BOSH, prior
        to deploying. If you change this, make sure to have genesis
        regenerate your SSL certificate.

    - param: bosh_hostname
      description: |
        The fully-qualified domain name for the BOSH director, in case you
        want to access it by name, instead of by IP.  This name will be
        added to the BOSH certificate as a subject alternate name, so if you
        change this, make sure to have genesis regenerate your SSL
        certificate.

    - param: bosh_network

        this BOSH director (an _environment_ BOSH).  It holds the alias of
        the BOSH director that will be used to deploy this BOSH.
