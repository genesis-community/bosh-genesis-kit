# New Features

* Added new feature `vault-credhub-proxy`.
  - Provides communication with BOSH internal credhub using [safe](https://github.com/starkandwayne/safe)
  - Provides the `vault-proxy-login` addon to target and log into credhub using safe.

* Added new feature `external-db`.
  - Support for using an external postgres database for BOSH, Credhub, and UAA.
    This does not provide any auto data migration from existing internal 
    databases. Users and passwords for the required database users will be 
    generated by safe at `/bosh/external-db/`. This requires a param in the 
    environment yaml `external_db_host`, the hostname of the database.
  - TLS is enabled by default for the database. If you need to provide bosh with 
    a CA for the external database, use the feature `external-db-ca` and specify 
    the param `external_db_ca` in the environment yaml. 
  - TLS can be disabled with the feature `external-db-no-tls`.
