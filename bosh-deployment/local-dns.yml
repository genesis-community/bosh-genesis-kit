# This file was used to enable the local_dns feature of bosh.
# bosh dns is now the default in bosh.yml.
#
# This ops-file is temporarily here for backwards compatibility to ensure no pipelines are broken.
#
# To configure your upstream DNS provider please use the misc/dns.yml ops file to override the default (Google DNS).
